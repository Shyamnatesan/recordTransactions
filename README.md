THERE ARE 2 ENDPOINTS HERE.
1. POST METHOD => TO RECORD TRANSACTIONS
2. GET METHOD => TO GET TRANSACTIONS

PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD.
1. POST METHOD => MAKES AN ASYNCHRONOUS REQUEST TO HANDLE RECORDING/SAVING OF TRANSACTIONS. SAVES THE TRANSACTION IN THE DATABASE.
2. GET METHOD => USES COMPLETABLE FUTURE TO HANDLE CONCURRENT READS. GETS ALL THE TRANSACTIONS MADE IN THAT DAY.

COULD HAVE WROTE THIS IN A SINGLE THREAD, 
SINCE THE TASK INVOLVED PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD STUFF => ONE WRITE OPERATION AND ONE READ OPERATION.
BUT I USED CONCURRENCY HERE BECAUSE I HAVE NOT WRITTEN MULTITHREADING IN A LONG TIME AND IT WAS A GOOD EXERCISE.

ADDITONAL IMPOROVEMENTS LIKE CACHING COULD BE DONE. WHEN PERFORMING READS FOR THE DAY, PAGINATION ALSO COULD BE IMPLEMENTED.
